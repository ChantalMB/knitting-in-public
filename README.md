# Knitting in Public

This website was created as a final performance project for the course HIST5707: Narrativity and Performance in Public History as instructed by Dr David Dean. All illustrations and uncited photographs were produced by me, Chantal Brousseau, and the website itself was created using the Sveltekit web framework.
